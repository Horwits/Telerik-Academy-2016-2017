READ CAREFULLY

READ INPUT

READ WHAT SHOULD BE OUTPUTTED

READ THE CONSTRAINS -> THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE HINT OF WHAT DATA STRUCTURE TO USE

DO A PLAN OF YOUR SOLUTION
	IS THIS PLAN THE BEST? 
	IS THERE A BETTER SOLUTION?
	WHAT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS?
	WHAT ARE THE BORDER CASES?
	WHERE THIS SOLUTION CAN BREAK?

THINK OF THE BEST DATA STRUCTURES ->
	THE STRINGBUILDER IS A LOT FASTER THAN THE CHAR ARRAY, THE LIST<CHAR> AND THE STRINGS

1. Task - i have all the algorithms needed.

2. Task
	- if we have to jump postions to the right -> if the jump is bigger than the length jump%length will give the position , also the jump will be from the position at most cases so 0 + 3, 1 + 3 etc.
	- if we have to jump position to the left -> jump%length and if it is < 0 ? jump + length
	- if we have to use char array or str -> the stringbuilder is the fastest

3. 

4. PLAN BEFORE CODING
	-if we have to encrypt something like aabaaa -> aab3a -> see the encrypt and encode from varant 2 14 september 2013 -> 2 while -> watch for the overflow , and the last symbol
